While Gauss's law representing "source" concept (where water flows out, where electricity field goes out or something). We might guess that Stokes's formula has something related too.

Let's write down the formula first:

$$
\int_{\Gamma} \vec{v} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{s} = \int_{\Sigma} \left( \frac{ \partial v_{z} }{ \partial y } - \frac{ \partial v_{y} }{ \partial z }, \frac{ \partial v_{x} }{ \partial z }  - \frac{ \partial v_{z} }{ \partial x }, \frac{ \partial v_{y} }{ \partial x } - \frac{ \partial v_{x} }{ \partial y }      \right) \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{S}
$$

So we can think of defining the vector on the right hand side to be $\vec{B}$ therefore we can write:

$$
\int_{\Gamma} \vec{v}  \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{s} = \int_{\Sigma} \vec{B} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{S}
$$
Physicists found that "B" is actually the circulation. For example, when a point is rotating around a point $p_{0}$. The velocity can be expressed as:
$$
\vec{v} = \vec{v_{0}} + \omega \times \vec{}r
$$
By cross product we get:

Take partial derivative we get:

Which is:

So remember we defined flux before, this time we define the left hand side integral to be circulation, and the $\vec{B}$ is called curl.
Also notice $\vec{B}$ is defined by the field solely, without picking an actual center rotation point.
What if we can't find the rotating center? Is there any other way to understand curl?

Just like div is defined by limitation we can do:

$$
\lim_{ \Sigma \to M} \frac{\int_{\partial \Sigma} \vec{a} \cdot \mathrm{ d } \vec{S}}{m\Sigma} 
$$
As we have to define the direction of $\Sigma$, we shall say that's the area density of the circulation of the field along a certain axis.

By MVT of integral, we see that "area density = curl * directed area". From this, we notice when we choose a $\Sigma$ with normal vector along curl, the density should be maximum. That's kind of the meaning of curl.
