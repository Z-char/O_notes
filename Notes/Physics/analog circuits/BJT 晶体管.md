To understand how BJT works, we need to dive into why people need BJT.
BJT is designed to amplify current, how?
Well, imagine we have a diode, let it under backward voltage, we have a backward current. Where does the backward current come from? The minority current taker other than PN-junction. If we are able to add the population, the current should be bigger.

When we add a voltage, the field in the first PN junction is suppressed and e+ goes right and e- goes left, while the second PN junction is locked and e- on the left cannot go, but, they allow any e+ to go across this field.

And we should be able to read this picture now, BE is the PN here. When we apply a small pressure, it bombs and gives out a bunch of current. And we make the B part very thin therefore only a few current flows $I_B$. CB is the NP here and let all current passes. For this picture, we know $I_E = I_B + I_C$. In this case, we amplify the current ($I_B$ become $I_E$).
