Holder's inequality is a generalized form of "Cauchy-Schwarz" inequality, considering integral as inner product.
Let's see.
> [!Holder's Inequality]
> Let $f, g$ are $C[a, b]$, and $p, q \gt 0, \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$.
> Then:
> $$
> \begin{align}
> \int_{a}^{b}|f(x)g(x)|{\rm d}x \le \left(\int_{a}^{b}|f(x)|^{p}{\rm d}x\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} \left(\int_{a}^{b}|g(x)|^{q}{\rm d}x\right)^{\frac{1}{q}}
> \end{align}
   $$

When $p = q = 2$, that's pretty much Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
I'm not fully understand the process of proving it.
For now, I will simply put other's proof here.
There are also good resources from uoft and connell just by searching holder's inequality.
