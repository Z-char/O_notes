The basic rule is simple and can be described as the following format:
```Makefile
dest file: source files
	(tab)command to compile # comments
```
E.g.
```Makefile
hello: hello.c
	g++ hello.c -o hello
```
And run `make` under the folder, the first project (dest file) will be generated by your command.
Sometimes we may want some other commands such as clean obj files.
Let's say:
```Makefile
clean:
	rm *.obj
```
Well as when we run `make` the first will be executed, we need `make clean` to explicitly run this one.
But what if there is such a file named `clean`? How should program know if that's a dest file or not?
We can explicitly declare a command to be phony.
```Makefile
.PHONY: clean
```
This command tells program that clean is not a dest file (even there is one named clean).

Why is this useful? So it makes compiling easier cause we don't have to `g++` and `g++` if we have thousands of files. Also, we don't want to `g++` all if we only change one! `make` will detect if a source is updated or not to determine should the dest file to be updated or not.
